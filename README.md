# AWS EventBridge ECS Playground

A sample project to experiment with AWS services, focusing on **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**, **EventBridge**, and **Infrastructure-as-Code**. This playground is designed to be set up in minutes by pointing to your AWS account.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Quick Setup**: Deploy everything to AWS in minutes
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: All infrastructure defined as code using Terraform
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Explore EventBridge patterns with ECS tasks
- **Local Development**: Full LocalStack support for testing without AWS costs

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project demonstrates:

- **ECS Fargate**: Containerized applications running on AWS
- **EventBridge**: Event-driven communication between services
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure
- **LocalStack**: Local AWS service emulation for development
- **Multi-Language Backend**: Implementations in .NET (initial), with Python, Golang, and Node.js alternatives planned

## 💻 Backend Implementations

This playground includes multiple backend implementations to experiment with different languages and their AWS SDKs:

- **.NET** (Initial): Full implementation with C# and AWS SDK for .NET
- **Python** (Planned): Alternative implementation using boto3
- **Golang** (Planned): Alternative implementation using AWS SDK for Go
- **Node.js** (Planned): Alternative implementation using AWS SDK for JavaScript/Node.js

Each implementation provides the same functionality, allowing you to compare:
- Language-specific AWS SDK patterns
- Containerization approaches
- Performance characteristics
- Developer experience across languages

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **project root directory** (same level as `docker-compose.yml` and `README.md`) with the following configuration:

```bash
# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id

# LocalStack Configuration (for local development)
LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
USE_LOCALSTACK=false

# Application Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Location:** `aws-eventbridge-ecs-playground/.env`

**Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed to version control. Create it locally for your development environment.

### AWS Permissions Required

- ECS: Create clusters, services, task definitions
- EventBridge: Create rules, targets, event buses
- IAM: Create roles and policies
- VPC: Create networking resources (if needed)
- CloudWatch: Create log groups

## 🧪 Testing

### Build and Test .NET Services

```bash
# Build .NET services
cd src/dotnet/EventProducer
dotnet build
dotnet test

cd ../EventConsumer
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

### Deploy and Test .NET Lambda in LocalStack

**Option 1: Container Image (requires registry on port 4510)**
```bash
# Start LocalStack (if not already running)
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy the Lambda function as container image
python scripts/deploy-lambda-localstack.py
```

**Option 2: ZIP Package (recommended if registry issues)**
```bash
# Start LocalStack (if not already running)
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy the Lambda function as ZIP package
python scripts/deploy-lambda-localstack-zip.py
```

**Test the Lambda:**
```bash
# Invoke the Lambda
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 lambda invoke \
  --function-name simple-lambda \
  --payload '{"test":"data"}' \
  response.json

# View the response
cat response.json  # Linux/Mac
# or
Get-Content response.json  # Windows PowerShell
```

**Note:** If the container registry (port 4510) is not accessible, use the ZIP package deployment method instead.

### Cold Start Performance: ZIP vs Container Images

**Container Images:**
- ✅ **Faster cold starts** - Pre-built, ready to run, no extraction needed
- ✅ **Better for production** - Optimized base images, better caching
- ✅ **More control** - Custom runtime, dependencies pre-installed
- ❌ Requires container registry (may have issues in LocalStack community edition)

**ZIP Packages:**
- ⚠️ **Slower cold starts** - ZIP must be extracted, runtime initialized on first invocation
- ✅ **Simpler deployment** - No registry needed, works reliably in LocalStack
- ✅ **Good for development** - Faster iteration, easier debugging
- ⚠️ Limited to supported runtimes (may not support .NET 10 in LocalStack)

**For LocalStack (Development):**
- Cold start differences are minimal since it's local
- ZIP packages are often more reliable for development/testing
- Use container images when testing production-like scenarios

**For AWS (Production):**
- Container images generally have better cold start performance
- Consider using Provisioned Concurrency for critical functions
- Monitor cold start metrics in CloudWatch

See `src/dotnet/SimpleLambda/README.md` for more details.

### Using LocalStack

LocalStack provides AWS service emulation via the API endpoint at `http://localhost:4566`.

**Example commands:**
```bash
# List S3 buckets
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls

# List Lambda functions
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 lambda list-functions

# List EventBridge rules
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 events list-rules
```

### Docker Configuration for Lambda Container Images

If you're deploying Lambda functions as container images, Docker needs to be configured to allow pushing to LocalStack's registry on port 4510.

**Configure Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac):**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** > **Docker Engine**
3. Add this to the JSON configuration (add to existing JSON, don't replace):
   ```json
   {
     "insecure-registries": ["localhost:4510", "127.0.0.1:4510"]
   }
   ```
   **Important:** If you already have other settings, merge this into your existing JSON.
4. Click **Apply & Restart**
5. Wait for Docker to fully restart (may take 1-2 minutes)

**Note:** The registry service may start lazily when you first push an image. If it still fails, try pushing again after a few seconds.

**Verify the configuration:**
```bash
python scripts/verify-localstack.py
```

This will check if both the API (port 4566) and registry (port 4510) are accessible.

### Test with LocalStack

```bash
# Start LocalStack
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform apply

# Send test event
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 events put-events \
  --entries '[{"Source":"test","DetailType":"Test Event","Detail":"{\"message\":\"Hello\"}"}]'

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Test with AWS

```bash
# Deploy to AWS
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform apply

# Send test event
aws events put-events \
  --entries '[{"Source":"test","DetailType":"Test Event","Detail":"{\"message\":\"Hello\"}"}]'

# View CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/playground --follow
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

### AWS
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform destroy
```

### LocalStack
```bash
# Using the teardown script (recommended)
python scripts/teardown-localstack.py

# Or manually
docker-compose down -v
# or
localstack stop
```
